Our ability to detect irregularities, and our response Fraud  Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud Fraud risk assessment To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud fraud risks we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud.

For example, the further removed noncompliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of nondetection of fraud, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing noncompliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect noncompliance with all laws and regulations.', '6.
